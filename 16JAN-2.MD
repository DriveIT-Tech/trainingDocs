# 🕰️ History of Unix & Linux – Timeline

----------

## 1960s – Birth of UNIX

### **1969 – UNIX (AT&T Bell Labs)**

-   Created by **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie**
    
-   Written initially in assembly, later rewritten in **C**
    
-   Designed to be:
    
    -   Multi-user
        
    -   Multi-tasking
        
    -   Portable
        

🔑 **Key idea:**

> “Write once, run anywhere” (thanks to C)

UNIX became the **foundation of almost every modern operating system**.

----------

## 1970s–1980s – UNIX Variants (Commercial & Academic)

### **1977 – BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)**

-   Developed at **UC Berkeley**
    
-   Added major innovations:
    
    -   TCP/IP networking
        
    -   Virtual memory
        
    -   Sockets API
        

📌 Many modern networking stacks originate from BSD.

----------

### **1980s – Commercial UNIX Flavors**

#### **Solaris (Sun Microsystems)**

-   UNIX for high-end servers
    
-   Famous for:
    
    -   Scalability
        
    -   ZFS filesystem
        
    -   Enterprise reliability
        

Used heavily in **telecom and financial systems**.

----------

#### **HP-UX (Hewlett-Packard)**

-   UNIX variant for HP PA-RISC / Itanium systems
    
-   Focused on:
    
    -   Stability
        
    -   Mission-critical workloads
        

Common in **banks and large enterprises**.

----------

#### **IBM AIX**

-   IBM’s UNIX for **POWER systems**
    
-   Strong in:
    
    -   Performance tuning
        
    -   Enterprise workloads
        
    -   Banking and ERP systems
        

Still used today in **core banking systems**.

----------

## 1983 – Free Software Movement

### **GNU Project – Richard Stallman**

-   Launched the **GNU Project**
    
-   Goal:
    
    -   Create a **free UNIX-like OS**
        
    -   Software freedom (run, study, modify, share)
        

Created:

-   GCC compiler
    
-   Bash shell
    
-   Core UNIX utilities
    

❗ **Missing piece:** a kernel

----------

## 1991 – Birth of Linux

### **Linux Kernel – Linus Torvalds**

-   Linus Torvalds released the **Linux kernel**
    
-   Inspired by UNIX, but written from scratch
    
-   Combined with GNU tools → **GNU/Linux**
    

🔑 This combination created a **free, open-source UNIX-like OS**.

----------

## Early Linux Distributions

### **1993 – Slackware**

-   One of the **earliest Linux distributions**
    
-   Very minimal
    
-   Manual configuration
    

Still respected for **purity and simplicity**.

----------

### **1993 – Debian**

-   Community-driven distribution
    
-   Focus on:
    
    -   Stability
        
    -   Free software principles
        
    -   Package management (`.deb`, `apt`)
        

Foundation for many future distros.

----------

## Modern Linux Era

### **2004 – Ubuntu**

-   Based on Debian
    
-   Sponsored by **Canonical**
    
-   Goals:
    
    -   User-friendly
        
    -   Regular release cycles
        
    -   Strong cloud support
        

Became the **default Linux for cloud and developers**.

----------

### **2000 – Red Hat Linux → RHEL**

-   Red Hat focused on:
    
    -   Enterprise support
        
    -   Certifications
        
    -   Long-term stability
        

Used heavily in:

-   Enterprises
    
-   Banks
    
-   Government
    

----------

### **2003 – Fedora**

-   Community-driven Red Hat project
    
-   Acts as:
    
    -   Innovation upstream for RHEL
        
    -   Testing ground for new features
        

Used by:

-   Developers
    
-   Linux enthusiasts

## 🎯 Key Takeaways (Infra Perspective)

-   UNIX defined **stability and design principles**
    
-   BSD powered **networking**
    
-   Commercial UNIX dominated **enterprises**
    
-   GNU provided **freedom and tooling**
    
-   Linux unified everything into a **free, scalable OS**
